# Data
This repository includes sample data from a dynamic environment used in an online study.

Patch: Indicates the current choice made by the participant.
Reward: The reward received for the current choice.
Times: Can be ignored — these timestamps are messy due to the nature of the online study.
Names: Arbitrary identifiers ids.
p0, p1, ..., p8: Represent the rewards available for each patch if it were chosen next — essentially showing the expected reward for switching to that patch, THESE CANT BE SEEN BY THE PARTICIPANTS.
